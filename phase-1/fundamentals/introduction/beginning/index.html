  Core Deliverables
  1. Write a preamble that lets the browser know that this document's type is HTML.
  2. Write a <head> and <body>.
  3. Link this file to `index.js`, so that the browser loads that file **after** loading the <body>.
-->

<!-- This preamble tells the browser that our document type is HTML. (I'm about to write an HTML doc)
Other doctypes are rare (used more in the past) - HTML most common doctype (often assumed to be HTML if preamble tag is missing) -->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- The head tag's content is the metadata, or non-visual data of our page (e.g., language, title). -->
<head>
  <meta lang="en" /> <!-- No content in metadata tags, but has attributes -->
  <title>My website!</title>
  <!-- Script tag can have JS content directly, or have an attribute that links to a js file
  Defer tag ensure it's not executed until all HTML is loaded; required when putting script tag in head instead of body
  HTML file may not get read in if defer tag is not included -->
  <script defer src="./index.js"></script>
</head>

<!-- Body tag is for visual elements. -->
<body>
  <!-- h1, img, div, p, a, span, etc. -->
  <!-- h1-6 header tags (in order of decreasing imporatance) -->
  <h1>An Introduction to HTML</h1>
  <h2>by Angela Tolwani</h2>
  <!-- div: divider tag -->
  <div>
    <h3>Some less important heading...</h3>
  </div>
  <!-- paragraph tag for plain text -->
  <p>Some text...</p>
